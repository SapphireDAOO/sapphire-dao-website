/**
 * Custom hook to fetch invoice data from the PaymentProcessor smart contract using an invoice key.
 *
 * This function calls `getInvoiceData(orderId)` on the contract and retrieves details
 * such as token address, amount, receiver address, and any other metadata stored in the invoice.
 *
 * @param orderId - The unique key (address) used to identify the invoice on-chain.
 *
 * @returns An object containing:
 *   - `data`: The invoice data returned by the contract. This is typically an object that includes fields like `token`, `amount`, `receiver`, etc.
 *   - `refetch`: A function to manually re-fetch the invoice data.
 *   - `isLoading`: Boolean indicating whether the contract read is currently in progress.
